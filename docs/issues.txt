known bugs/issues:

* win32: ableton live crashes when closing the editor, and reopening it again

  confirmed in wine/bitwig
  editor opens ok initially, but if i close it, then reopen it, it crashes
  does not happen if i resize editor before closing
  suggesting something is not reset/reinit'ed
  check what resizing does that makes it not crash

  .. same thing happen in linux/vst3 (bitwig)
